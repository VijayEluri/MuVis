Known Issues:
	
Preview operation:
Currently suports tracks, albums and artists previews. There may be some mp3 
files that cannot be played, but this is not MuVis fault. MP3 playback library 
might not support the desired file. So we cannot give any feedback about this.

Library loading:
Like the preview functionality, some tracks won't be loaded into MuVis application.
This is because the MP3 playback library and so, we cannot provide any support
about this issue, instead we can hope, this library developers will fixe it
as I wrote.
